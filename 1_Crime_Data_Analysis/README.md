## Analysis of Graphs

### 1. Frequency of Top 5 Offences (2018 - 2023)
![Frequency of Top 5 Offences](Images/Frequency_of_Top_5_Offences(2018-2023).png)

This chart shows that theft-related offences significantly outnumber other crimes, suggesting a persistent issue with property crimes. "Public order offences" and "Other thefts" also feature prominently, indicating recurring issues with disorderly conduct and public safety.

### 2. Selected Offences with 500-5000 Occurrences (2018 - 2023)

This graph highlights offences like "Other drug offences" and "Robbery of an establishment," which are less frequent but still notable. Drug-related offences indicate ongoing issues with controlled substances, while the steady rate of robberies suggests a continued risk to businesses.

### 3. Trend of Selected Offences (2015 - 2023) - Theft, Public Order, and Disorderly Conduct

Theft-related offences show a significant decline around 2020, likely due to COVID-19 lockdowns, followed by a return to previous levels. "Public order" and "Disorderly conduct" offences remain stable, showing consistent challenges in maintaining public order.

### 4. Trend of Selected Offences (2015 - 2023) - Violent Crimes
![Trend of Selected Offences - Violent Crimes](Images/Trend_of_Selected_Offences(2015-2023)_2.png)

"Assault causing harm" and "Sexual offences" show an upward trend, suggesting a rise in violent crime or an improvement in reporting. Robberies remain stable, highlighting both consistent security efforts and potential areas for further preventive measures.

### 5. Trends of Selected Offences with 500-5000 Occurrences (2018 - 2023)
![Trends of Selected Offences with 500-5000 Occurrences](Images/Trends_of_Selected_Offences_with_occurrences(500-5000)_from(2018-2023).png)

This graph shows fluctuations in offences like "Blackmail or extortion" and "Offences against government," possibly tied to specific events. "Endangering traffic" and "Possession of firearms" remain stable, indicating steady enforcement or societal norms.

### 6. Trends of Selected Offences with 10-200 Occurrences (2003 - 2023)
![Trends of Selected Offences with 10-200 Occurrences](Images/Trends_of_Selected_Offences_with_occurrences(10-200)_from(2003-2023).png)

This graph covers low-frequency but serious crimes. "Aggravated sexual assault" shows a recent decline, possibly due to improved prevention. Occasional spikes in "Unseaworthy/dangerous use of boat or ship" may reflect maritime incidents or enforcement changes.

### 7. Trends of Top Offences (2018 - 2023)
![Trends of Top Offences](Images/Trends_of_Top_Offences(2018-2023).png)

This chart illustrates the impact of the pandemic on crime, with theft-related offences declining sharply in 2020. As restrictions lifted, these crimes returned to prior levels, suggesting that theft is influenced by socio-economic factors. Public order offences remain steady, indicating ongoing issues with public disorder.
